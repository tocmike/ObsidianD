3\. After your download code has been accepted, you will be given two 32 digit unique Product Activation Codes, one for Cubase LE and one for Retrologue 2.
You will also get the download link for the Steinberg Download Assistant for both Mac and Windows. Click the appropriate link and wait for the download to finish.
